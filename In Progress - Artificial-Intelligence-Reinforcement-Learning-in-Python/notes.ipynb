    "### Notes\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning is more different from supervised and unsupervised machine learning are from each other.\n",
    "- Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning use gathered, labelled or unlabelled data.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning interfaces with an environment (simulated environment or through sensors).\n",
    "- Objective of the RL is to minimize the cost / maximize the reward.\n",
    "- The agent makes actions and feedback signals (in form of the reward) are automatically given to the agent by the environment.\n",
    "- This course will only look at finite state space enviroment."
